SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems:
- Collect, aggregate, and analyze data from organization-wide sources (apps, servers, devices, users)
- Detect and respond to threats in real time
- Centralize security visibility across environments
- Help with compliance, investigations, and threat response
