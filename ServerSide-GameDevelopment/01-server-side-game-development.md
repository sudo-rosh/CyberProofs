# 🕹️ Server-Side Game Development  

The term **"server-side"** refers to operations performed by the server in a **client-server relationship** within a computer network.  

In games, the server-side is responsible for:  
- 🧩 Logic and rules of the game  
- 💾 Data persistence  
- 🔒 Security  
- 🔄 Synchronization of the game state among all connected clients  

Essentially, the server handles all processing **not done on the client-side**.  

Server-side code can be written in multiple languages, commonly including:  
- PHP  
- Ruby  
- Python  
- .NET  
- Java  
- JavaScript (Node.js)  

👉 Mastering server-side programming is critical for game developers to build **maintainable, scalable, and secure** online games.
