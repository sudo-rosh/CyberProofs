# Cybersecurity Roadmap: First Stop – Fundamental IT Skills

## Overview

Fundamental IT skills are the building blocks of a cybersecurity career. They include understanding computer hardware and software, operating systems (Windows, Linux), networking basics, and at least one programming language like Python or JavaScript. Knowledge of databases (SQL), cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), and basic cybersecurity concepts—such as encryption, access control, and common attack vectors—helps professionals identify vulnerabilities, protect systems, and respond to incidents effectively. Troubleshooting, log analysis, and basic web tech understanding are essential for day-to-day cybersecurity tasks.
