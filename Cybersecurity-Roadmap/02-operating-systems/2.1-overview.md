# Cybersecurity Roadmap: Second Stop – Operating Systems

## Overview

An **Operating System (OS)** acts as the middle layer between hardware and software.  
When a system boots up, it runs a process called **bootstrap**, which initializes the hardware and loads device drivers. From there, the OS manages how programs interact with hardware through **system calls** and handles resources such as memory and CPU scheduling.

Key responsibilities of an OS include:
- **Device Drivers** → Ensure hardware and software can communicate.  
- **System Calls** → Allow applications to request services from hardware.  
- **Memory Management** → Allocates and frees memory blocks for programs.  
- **Multitasking** → Runs multiple programs simultaneously by managing resources efficiently.

## Types of Operating Systems (Quick Categories)

*(Based on research; summarized in my own words)*

1. **Real-Time OS** → Executes tasks with predictable timing (e.g., LynxOS, Symbian).  
2. **Multi-user vs Single-user** → Allows one or multiple users at a time (e.g., Unix = multi-user, Windows = single-user).  
3. **Multi-tasking vs Single-tasking** → Supports running multiple processes at once (Linux = multi-tasking, Palm OS = single-tasking).  
4. **Distributed OS** → Connects multiple machines to act like one system (e.g., Amoeba, Plan9).  
5. **Embedded OS** → Runs on devices with limited resources (e.g., Embedded Linux, Minix).  
6. **Mobile OS** → Designed for wireless devices (e.g., Android, iOS).  
7. **Batch Processing** → Runs jobs in groups without manual input (e.g., IBM z/OS).  
8. **Interactive Systems** → Require user input during execution.

## Hands-On: Windows Commands

Some useful OS-level commands for security analysis and troubleshooting:

- `systeminfo` → Shows OS version, hardware specs, and security settings.  
- `tasklist` → Lists running processes (helps detect suspicious activity).  
- `dir` → Displays contents of a directory.  
- `ipconfig` → Shows network configuration.  
- `netstat -an` → Lists active network connections.

## Reflection: Why OS Knowledge Matters in Cybersecurity

Every operating system has its own structure, commands, and vulnerabilities.  
Understanding how an OS works helps:
- Detect unusual processes or network activity.  
- Secure systems more effectively.  
- Analyze logs and respond to incidents faster.
