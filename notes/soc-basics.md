## 🎯 Mission of Cybersecurity:
1. **Prevention**
2. **Detection** ← SOC responsibility
3. **Response** ← SOC responsibility

---

## 👥 Roles in a SOC:

### ▪️ SOC Manager  
🧠 Organizes and oversees operations  

### ▪️ SOC Engineer  
🛠️ Installs, configures, and maintains security tools  

### ▪️ SOC Analyst (T1, T2, T3)  
🔍 Responds to alerts, investigates incidents, finds root causes  

### ▪️ Threat Hunter  
🎯 Proactively hunts for hidden threats using hypotheses

## 🧰 Tools Used in a SOC:

### 1. **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management)  
- Real-time visibility into system activities  
- Alerts when something suspicious happens  
- Can track data access or exfiltration attempts  

### 2. **UBA** (User Behavior Analytics)  
- Flags unusual user activity  
- Sends alarms for anomalies like sudden data transfers  

### 3. **XDR** (Extended Detection and Response)  
- Collects and stores logs/data for later investigation  
- Useful for long-term threat analysis  

⚠️ **Difference from SIEM:**  
- SIEM gives immediate data  
- XDR stores and retrieves data when needed  

### 4. **SOAR** (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)  
- Coordinates response processes  
- Uses playbooks for incident handling  
- Opens cases and tracks resolution progress

## 💬 Questions / Confusions:
- How does SOAR integrate with SIEM tools in practice?
- What does a Tier 1 analyst’s daily routine *actually* look like?

🧠 _“SOC is not just tools and logs — it's a whole system for catching threats *before* they become headlines.”_
